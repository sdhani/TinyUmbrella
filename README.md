## TinyUmbrella :umbrella:
A collection of mini-projects focused on building out small android application features using Android Studio and Java.

- **ArrowSpinOff**
  - Implements an animation sequence for a spinning arrow tied to a count-down clock.
- **HamburgerBlitz**
  - Attempts to create an interactive board that responds to user interaction. It currently uses a GridView layout of buttons tied to the 'Square' class and 'SquareAdapter' class for reactionary output. Button response is currently inactive. The Square class customizes each button as a square object. 

- **Match3Logic**
  - The Match3Logic project currently allows the user to grab child view objects and move them around the screen.
